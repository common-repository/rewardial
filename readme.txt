After having successfully performed above steps, you should now be able to see a distinct Rewardial menu on the left-hand side of your WordPress Dashboard.
3. Validate the plug-in by inserting or creating a new user on the Rewardial server. In order to use our plug-in, you need a valid account from the Rewardial server and have to accept our terms and conditions stating that the plug-in communicates and sends data to the Rewardial server. The Rewardial platform will store user data required for running the plug-in - currently online the user login data. To perform the validation process:
    1. Click on the Rewardial menu option on the left-hand side of the WordPress Dashboard. You will have 2 available forms:
        + Register as WordPress blogger
        + Add this blog to an existing Rewardial blogger's account
    2. For the first registration, please use the Register as WordPress blogger form and fill in:
        + First Name
        + Last Name
        + E-mail Address
        + Password
        + Repeat Password
    3. On pressing Register to the form the following will happen:
        + A Rewardial Blogger account is created.
        + The current website is automatically attached to the Blogger account.
    4. If you already have a Blogger account on the Rewardial platform, you may attach the current website to the platform by using the second form - Add this blog to an existing Rewardial blogger's account. In this form you would only have to provide your E-mail Address and Rewardial platform password and the current website will be attached to your existing account on pressing the Add button.
    5. Once the registration process or attaching the website to an existing account have been successfully performed:
        + The 2 previous forms will be replaced by a display of the account details.
